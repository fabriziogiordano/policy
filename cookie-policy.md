Vimeo.com Cookie Policy
=======================

Last Updated: January 2013

This Cookie Policy is part of our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) and explains:

- What cookies are
- What cookies Vimeo uses both on Vimeo.com and its embedded player
- When cookies expire
- How you can manage your cookie options

1. What is a cookie? 
---------------------

 A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device for record keeping purposes. It usually contains the domain that it is associated with (e.g., Vimeo.com) and a unique, randomly assigned number that allows us (or a third party) to know when â&#128;&#156;youâ&#128;&#157; are using our service. Cookies can either be session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires automatically when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive until it expires or you delete your cookies.

 When you visit our site, Vimeo or a third party weâ&#128;&#153;ve contracted with may place a number of cookies on your computer or mobile device. Cookies placed by the website youâ&#128;&#153;re visiting are sometimes called â&#128;&#156;first party cookies,â&#128;&#157; while cookies placed by third parties, like analytics companies or ad networks, are sometimes called â&#128;&#156;third party cookies.â&#128;&#157;

2. What cookies are used when I visit Vimeo.com?
------------------------------------------------

 When you use Vimeo.com, you might interact with the cookies listed <a href="">here</a>. We update this list quarterly, so there may be additional cookies that arenâ&#128;&#153;t yet listed. Each cookie serves one of four different purposes: (1) to enable essential website functions; (2) to provide analytics data; (3) to store preferences; and (4) to enable behavioral advertising.

 <table class="data cookies"><thead><tr><th> Category </th> <th> Description </th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><th> 1. Essential step cookies </th> <td>These cookies allow you to use an essential function of our website, such as:

- Staying logged into Vimeo
- Viewing a private video or album
- Watching videos in Couch mode
- Making purchases from Vimeo
 
</td> </tr><tr><th> 2. Analytics cookies </th> <td> These cookies help track information about how our site is being used so that we can make improvements and report our performance. We use our own cookies to track performance and measure the results of tests we conduct. Our analytics providers, including Google Analytics, also set cookies for analytics purposes. </td> </tr><tr><th> 3. Preference Cookies </th> <td>These cookies store your Vimeo preferences, such as:

- Language preference
- Volume preference
- HD mode preference
 
</td> </tr><tr><th> 4. Ad targeting cookies </th> <td>These cookies are placed by third party advertising platforms or networks in order to:

- Track advertising delivery and performance (e.g., the number of ads delivered and whether they were clicked on).
- Enable advertising networks to build user profiles in order to deliver ads that may be relevant to you based upon your actions on Vimeo or another website. For example, if an ad network knows that you have recently searched for the term â&#128;&#156;camera,â&#128;&#157; it might be able to display camera ads to you.

--------------------------------------------------------

 If youâ&#128;&#153;re not using Vimeo.com, you might still interact with Vimeo cookies when you visit a third party page that has a Vimeo video embedded in it. When you watch this video, the following cookies may be placed on your computer or mobile device: [Explain].

 4. Do third parties use cookies to collect my personal information? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Cookies themselves donâ&#128;&#153;t collect data; rather, they allow us (or a third party) to recognize you and associate you with certain activities on our site. We do not provide third party analytics companies or advertisers with personal information that you have provided to us, such as your name or email address.

 These companies might, however, track your IP address and associate it with a cookie. IP address information is used for either analytics or ad delivery/targeting purposes. For example, an analytics company will use IP addresses tell us how many users we have in different countries. And an ad company might use IP addresses to deliver ads in certain countries, but not others. Third parties generally anonymize IP address information after they receive it.

 5. When do persistent cookies expire? 
---------------------------------------

 It depends on the cookie. Some last for a few minutes to a few hours, while some will not expire for years (unless you delete them). For the list of expiration dates, see our list of cookies here [LINK].

 6. What options do I have?
