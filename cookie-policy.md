Vimeo Cookie Policy
===================

Last Updated: January 2013

 Vimeo uses cookies on Vimeo.com and related domains and applications (the â&#128;&#156;Vimeo Serviceâ&#128;&#157;). By using the Vimeo Service, you consent to the use of cookies. If you are embedding the Vimeo video player on your website, you should make appropriate disclosures about cookies to your users.

 This Cookie Policy is part of our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) and explains:

- What cookies are
- What cookies are used when you use the Vimeo Service
- How third parties use cookies on the Vimeo Service
- Your cookie options
- Further cookie resources

1. What is a cookie? 
---------------------

 A cookie is a small text file that is stored in your web browser that allows Vimeo or a third party to recognize you. Cookies might be used for the following purposes: (1) to enable certain functions; (2) to provide analytics; (3) to store your preferences; and (4) to enable ad delivery and behavioral advertising.

 Cookies can either be session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires automatically when you close your browser. A persistent cookie will remain until it expires or you delete your cookies. Expiration dates are set in the cookies themselves; some may expire after a few minutes while others may expire after multiple years. Cookies placed by the website youâ&#128;&#153;re visiting are sometimes called â&#128;&#156;first party cookies,â&#128;&#157; while cookies placed by other companies are sometimes called â&#128;&#156;third party cookies.â&#128;&#157;

2. What cookies are used when I use the Vimeo Service?
------------------------------------------------------

 When you use the Vimeo Service or visit a webpage with a Vimeo video, Vimeo or a third party may place a number of cookies in your browser. Some of the cookies will only be used if you use certain features or select certain preferences, and some cookies will always be used. You can find out more about each cookie by viewing our current [cookie list](#cookie_list). We update this list quarterly, so there may be additional cookies that arenâ&#128;&#153;t yet listed.

 Each cookie serves one of four different purposes:

 <table class="data"><thead><tr><th> Category </th> <th> Description </th> </tr></thead><tbody><tr><th> 1. Essential cookies </th> <td>These first party cookies allow you to use a feature of the Vimeo Service, such as:

- Staying logged in
- Viewing a private video or album
- Watching videos in Couch mode
- Making purchases
 
</td> </tr><tr><th> 2. Analytics cookies </th> <td> These cookies track information about how the Vimeo Service is being used so that we can make improvements and report our performance. We might also use analytics cookies to test new ads, pages, or features to see how users react to them. Analytics cookies may either be first party cookies or third party cookies. </td> </tr><tr><th> 3. Preference Cookies </th> <td>These first party cookies store your Vimeo Service preferences, such as:

- Language preference
- Volume preference
- HD mode preference
 
</td> </tr><tr><th> 4. Ad targeting cookies </th> <td>These third party cookies are placed by advertising platforms or networks in order to:

- Deliver ads and track ad performance
- Enable advertising networks to deliver ads that may be relevant to you based upon your activities (this is sometimes called â&#128;&#156;behavioralâ&#128;&#157; or â&#128;&#156;targetedâ&#128;&#157; advertising)
 
</td></tr></tbody></table> 3. How do third parties use cookies on the Vimeo Service? 
-----------------------------------------------------------

 Third party companies like analytics companies and ad networks generally use cookies to collect user information on an anonymous basis. They may use that information to build a profile of your activities on the Vimeo Service and other websites that youâ&#128;&#153;ve visited. You can learn more about how these companies use your information by visiting the privacy policies listed in our [cookie list](#cookie_list).

 4. What are my cookie options? 
--------------------------------

 If you donâ&#128;&#153;t like the idea of cookies or certain types of cookies, you can change your browserâ&#128;&#153;s settings to delete cookies that have already been set and to not accept new cookies. To learn more about how to do this, visit the help pages of your browser. Please note, however, that if you delete cookies or do not accept them, you might not be able to use all of the features we offer, you may not be able to store your preferences, and some of our pages might not display properly.

 You may also opt out of third party cookies by following the instructions provided by each third party in its privacy policy. Please see our [cookie list](#cookie_list) for links to the third party privacy policies. Some third party ad networks are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI). You can visit the [NAIâ&#128;&#153;s website](http://www.networkadvertising.org) to find out how to opt out of membersâ&#128;&#153; cookies.

 5. Do you use any other user tracking technologies? 
-----------------------------------------------------

 We use additional technologies to help track user activities and preferences. For example, we use web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs). Web beacons are tiny graphics (about the size of period) with a unique identifier that are embedded invisibly on web pages or emails. They are used to track user activities and communicate with cookies. You cannot opt out of web beacons used in webpages, but you can limit their use by opting out of the cookies they interact with. You can opt out of web beacons used in emails by setting your email client to render emails in text mode only. Finally, we use local storage to facilitate certain functions, but we do not retain the data captured via local storage.

 6. Where can I find more information about cookies?
