Terms of Service
================

Last updated: October 2009

**PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING OR USING THE WWW.VIMEO.COM WEBSITE OR RELATED SERVICES. While we’ve endeavored to make these Terms of Service easier to read and understand by providing the “Vimeo-speak” explanations, please note that it is the “Lawyer-speak” section that comprises the actual, legally-binding Terms of Service. As such, the “Vimeo-speak” section should be seen as a guide or overview only.**

### Vimeo Speak

### Lawyer Speak

These are the terms and conditions that apply to all users of Vimeo. Since we can’t sit down with all of you to get signatures and such, your use of our website tells us you agree to have these terms and conditions apply.

Sometimes we need to update or revise these terms and conditions. You can always tell when that has happened by looking at the “last updated” heading, above. If you keep using the website after the Last Updated date, you’re saying you agree to have the updated or revised terms and conditions apply.

We care about your privacy, too. So much that we’ve created a separate document outlining our privacy-related policies. [You can read that here](/privacy).

Make sure you understand and agree to these terms before you start using the Vimeo website or services.

Welcome to [vimeo.com](http://www.vimeo.com), operated by Vimeo, LLC (“VIMEO”, “we” or “us”). **By using the services offered on or through www.vimeo.com (the “Vimeo Site”) you are agreeing to the terms and conditions set forth below (the “Terms of Service” or “TOS”)**. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms of Service at any time. You can always check out the most current version of these Terms of Service at this page. You can determine when these Terms of Service was last revised by referring to the “Last Updated” legend at the top of these Terms of Service.

In addition to these Terms of Service, your use of the Vimeo Site and/or Services is governed by our [Privacy Policy](/privacy). You agree to VIMEO’s collection, use and sharing of your information as set forth in the Privacy Policy, which may be amended by us from time to time in our discretion. When using particular Services (as defined below), you will be subject to any posted terms or guidelines applicable to such services, and any other terms or conditions applicable to Services provided by or in conjunction with any of VIMEO’s content and service partners. The Privacy Policy and any posted terms or guidelines are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service.

**If you do not understand and agree to these Terms of Service, please do not use the Vimeo Site or any Services (as defined below), and do not register to be a member of VIMEO**. If you have any questions or concerns regarding these Terms of Service, please let us know by contacting us [here](/help). Do not use the Services until these questions and concerns have been answered to your satisfaction, and you agree to abide by the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service.

Overview
--------

There’s lots to do here, and we’re always improving and adding features and functionality. You can upload and share both high- and standard-definition videos; send messages to other members; add other members as contacts; create and moderate “channels” and “groups” based around specific interests, and participate in discussions.

Vimeo offers two types of membership: basic (free) and Plus (paid subscription). Some services may only be available to Plus members. [You can read about the different membership options here.](/help/faq#comparison)

The Vimeo Site offers a multi-purpose service, with both basic (free) and Plus (paid subscription) membership options, which allows you to, among other things, upload and share both high- and standard-definition video footage; send messages to other members; post comments about videos, add other members as contacts; create and moderate “channels” and “groups” based around specific interests, and participate in Forums (as more fully described below) (collectively, and together with the Site, the “Services”). Services may be offered by VIMEO itself, or by a third party partner/service provider. Certain Services may only be available to Plus subscribers. Unless otherwise stated, these Terms of Service apply to all Services. All content and additional or replacement services made available through the Vimeo Site that were not made available as of the "Last Updated" date above shall automatically be deemed to be part of the “Services” when first made available through the Vimeo Site.

**Notice to parents/guardians:** Portions of the Vimeo Site include user-generated-content, some of which contains “R-rated” material which may comprise nudity, violence or mature subject matter. VIMEO assumes no responsibility for filtering or monitoring the content viewed by its members; accordingly minor members’ parents or guardians shall be solely responsible for filtering and/or monitoring their child’s use of the Vimeo Site and/or Services.

Vimeo is always evolving, so we may add, modify, or stop certain services. You can stop using Vimeo at any time, but if you stick around we will assume you agree to such changes.

We reserve the right, at any time, to: (a) modify or discontinue some or all of the Services, including, but not limited to (i) restricting the time the Services are available, (ii) restricting the amount of use of the Services permitted (which may vary depending on membership level), and (iii) restricting or terminating any user’s right to use the Services, with or without notice; (b) charge fees in connection with the use of all or part of the Services; (c) modify and/or waive any fees charged in connection with the Services; and/or (d) offer opportunities to some or all users of the Services.

At all times you must retain all VIMEO or third party copyright and proprietary notices contained in the original materials or any copies thereof. All rights to ownership or use not expressly stated herein are reserved by Vimeo, LLC and Vimeo, LLC disclaims any and all implied licenses.

Registration—Basic/Plus Membership; Refund Policy
-------------------------------------------------

To really enjoy Vimeo, you need to register and become a member. When you register, you get to choose a user name. Be truthful, use your real name. Also, don’t choose a name that impersonates somebody else (famous people use our site, too—if you take their name, they’ll have to use yours!), that is obscene or objectionable, or that is someone’s brand or trademark—we’ll reject or change it.

In order to use certain Services, you must become a registered user of the Vimeo Site. You agree that Vimeo Site user names may be refused, changed, removed or replaced by us for reasons including, but not limited to, using a user name to impersonate another person, if a user name is offensive or violates third party intellectual property, etc . Please note that your user name may be viewed by the public, so you should not choose a user name that personally identifies you.

If you elect to register to use the Services (whether as a basic member, or as a paid subscriber to Vimeo Plus), utilize the Vimeo Site and/or participate in any VIMEO promotions, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the VIMEO registration form (such information being the “Registration Data”) and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it accurate. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete, or VIMEO has reasonable grounds to suspect that such is the case, VIMEO has the right to suspend or terminate your account (including paid, membership accounts) and refuse any and all current or future use of the Vimeo Site and/or Services (or any portion thereof).

**PROTECT YOUR PASSWORD. You are responsible for the activity that happens under your name**.

In addition to any other Registration Data, to register on the Vimeo Site you will be required to choose a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any password you may use to access the Services, and agree not to transfer your user name or password, or lend or otherwise transfer your use of or access to the Services, to any third party. You are fully responsible for all activity that occurs in connection with your user name or password. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your user name or password or any other breach of security related to your account or the Services, and to ensure that you “log off”/exit from your account (if applicable) at the end of each session. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with any of the foregoing obligations.

What are the benefits of Vimeo Plus? [See details here](/plus).

At any time you may elect to become a “Plus” member of the Vimeo Site by subscribing to Vimeo Plus and paying the associated subscription fee(s). Vimeo Plus members have greater storage and bandwidth allocations, and may have access to more areas, functions and types of Services than basic members.For an in depth description of the Vimeo Plus-specific services and benefits, as well as current pricing and subscription offerings, [click here](/plus).

Vimeo Plus annual subscriptions have a 30-day refund policy.

Vimeo Plus monthly subscriptions (if available) have a five (5) day refund policy.

We encourage you to buy Vimeo Plus annual with auto-renew during sign-up. Future renewals can always be cancelled.

**Vimeo Plus subscriptions may be subject to certain state, local or other relevant taxes. Annual subscribers to Vimeo Plus (as well as subscribers to multi-month subscriptions, should we make such subscription terms available) shall have thirty (30) days from the date of subscription to cancel their subscription for a full refund. If monthly subscriptions are offered, monthly subscribers to Vimeo Plus shall have five (5) days from the date of subscription to cancel their subscription for a full refund. After the cancellation period, purchases of Vimeo Plus subscriptions become FINAL and non-refundable, except in our sole and absolute discretion. At that point, you cannot return or cancel your subscription for a refund, and if your account is cancelled or terminated by you or by us, for any reason, you will lose and forfeit the remaining time on your subscription. The default setting for subscriptions is an annual, *auto-renewing* subscription. This means that each year on your subscription anniversary date, you will be charged the prevailing rate for an additional one-year subscription renewal. We may also offer shorter or longer term subscriptions (including monthly; multi-month—e.g., 3-month or 6-months at a time; or multi-year), which will also default to *auto-renew*. If you have signed up for an automatically-renewing subscription, you will have the ability to cancel any future renewals. If you have questions, feel free to contact [subscriptions@vimeo.com](mailto:subscriptions@vimeo.com)**.

Please note: Payments for Plus subscriptions are processed by a third party service provider and governed by separate Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For further information [click here](http://www.cybersource.com/privacy.php).

Profile Page
------------

All registered users of Vimeo automatically get a profile page that other users can see. Some information will always appear on your profile page, and some information is optional.

**PLEASE NOTE:** other users can read the information and messages left on your profile page. Use common sense to protect yourself and your personal information. Do not include any information on your profile that you do not want others to see.

When you register for a Vimeo Site account, a profile page will automatically be created for you and certain Registration Data will automatically be pre-populated in your profile page, including user name, profile image, the date you registered as a Vimeo Site user, and your gender. You may choose to add information (such as interests, personal description and location) to or delete certain information from your profile page, but your user name and the date you registered as a Vimeo Site user are required information for your profile page. Your profile page will also automatically display activity and any materials you have uploaded or otherwise submitted via the Services and marked “Public”. Please note that your profile page (including any comments that may have been left for you) may be viewed by other users, so you should not include any information in your profile page that you do not want others to see.

Material Storage and Delivery; Termination of Inactive Accounts
---------------------------------------------------------------

We may allocate a certain amount of storage space and bandwidth for different user types. These amounts may be changed by us from time-to-time. If you’re a Plus subscriber, we will not reduce your allocations during your current subscription term.

Basic accounts that are inactive for more than 90 days can be removed. Of course, we will send you an email before we take action. We will never remove Plus accounts for inactivity. Being active means simply visiting the site and logging in.

The amount of storage space and bandwidth per member may be limited (and may differ between basic members and Plus subscribers). The amount of storage space and bandwidth allocated to Plus subscribers, however, shall not be reduced during a subscriber’s then current subscription term. VIMEO may change the amount of storage space and/or bandwidth allocated to members from time-to-time, in its discretion.

Basic accounts may be terminated and/or deleted from our system if they remain inactive for a period of ninety (90) or more days; Plus accounts will remain active until the end of the subscription term. In the event of a suspension or deletion of an account (whether basic or Plus), materials (whether videos, still images, Forum posts, submissions or other communications) may no longer be accessible.

Accounts may be archived, or materials may be purged at such time intervals as VIMEO or its third party service provider(s) determine in their sole discretion. Some materials may not be stored, served or processed due to space constraints, serving/bandwidth limitations or disruptions in the system(s). You agree that VIMEO is not responsible or liable for the deletion or failure to store, serve or process any materials or other information.

Vimeo’s Privacy Policy
----------------------

Pursuant to VIMEO’s Privacy Policy, we may disclose to third parties certain information contained in your Registration Data or related data unless you choose to opt out from such disclosures. Please note: opting out may restrict your ability to utilize certain of the Services. We may also disclose such information if we have a good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, legal process, or to enforce these Terms of Service. For more information, please see our full [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

Channels, Groups, Forums & Comments
-----------------------------------

Vimeo is used by a lot of great people. Great people like to communicate and share thoughts and comments. Vimeo provides channels, groups, forums and other means for user communication and discussion.

Just like with user names, don’t choose a channel or group name that impersonates somebody else, that is obscene or objectionable, or that is someone’s brand or trademark—we’ll remove or change it.

Don’t use channels, groups, comments or forums to plug goods or services.

VIMEO offers users the ability to create “channels” or “groups” focused on a particular area of interest, and also offers access to Forums as part of the Services. A “Forum” refers to a bulletin board, virtual community or other means for users to engage in public commentary or discussion, which may be found in various areas of the Vimeo Site, including within channels and groups. You may make &lrsquo;comments” throughout the Vimeo Site, sharing your opinions about others’ content or send messages to individual users, as applicable. Channels, groups, comments and Forums are offered for, non-commercial use only. You shall not, without VIMEO’s express written approval, distribute or otherwise publish via any of the Services any material containing any solicitation of funds, promotion, advertising, or solicitation for goods or services.

As with all Services, your privilege to create channels and groups, make comments and to participate in the Forums is dependent on your continued compliance with these Terms of Service, specifically including the COMMUNITY STANDARDS AND CONDUCT policy below. VIMEO may revoke your privileges, terminate your registration/account or take any other measures deemed by VIMEO to be appropriate, in its sole discretion, to enforce these Terms of Service if violations are brought to our attention. You agree that VIMEO may change, remove or replace any channel or group name for any reason. We may refuse to grant you, and you may not use, a VIMEO channel or group name that is already being used by someone else; that may be construed as impersonating a company or another person; that belongs to a company or another person; that violates the intellectual property or other rights of any entity or person; that is offensive; or that we reject for any other reason. Please note that channel and group names may be viewed by the public, so you should not choose a channel or group name that personally identifies you.

Forum posts and comments are viewable by others, so think before you write!

**A NOTE ABOUT COMMUNICATION PRIVACY:** You should consider all communications to be public and not private communications. Although VIMEO reserves the right to remove without notice any Forum posting for any reason, we have no obligation to delete content that you may find objectionable or offensive.

Video Uploads
-------------

YOU MADE ‘EM, YOU KEEP ‘EM. YOU OWN YOUR VIDEOS—ALWAYS.

In order for us to accept your videos and provide the Vimeo services (all while following the law), we need certain rights and licenses in and to your videos, including:

- Right to copy your video. Example: Vimeo content is stored and passed through multiple servers, and is served to multiple users on multiple machines to allow our site to be up and running globally. Each time we put your video on another server, we are making a copy. This right lets us do that.
- Right to transmit, distribute & perform your video. Example: to send your videos from server to server; to show your videos to one or more Vimeo users and to display your videos on vimeo.com (or other websites), these are the rights we need.
- Right to create derivative works and modify your video. Example: the Vimeo system works by transcoding the video files you upload so that they may be stored and served smoothly and properly each and every time. When we transcode your video, we are modifying it and making another version—or a “derivative” version. We also may need to resize the video when displaying it to users and are thereby “modifying” it. These rights let us do that.
- Right to incorporate your video into other works. Example: the Vimeo site and player are also copyrighted and protected intellectual property. We incorporate your videos into the site and player. This right lets us do that.

You also grant Vimeo the right to use a portion of any video that has not been designated “private” for Vimeo mashups or other promotional purposes such as our Offline events or at conferences. Vimeo will not use your videos for other commercial purposes without your approval.

These rights and licenses are granted by you to us for free, so we can provide you with our services.

When you remove your content from Vimeo, these licenses to your videos terminate and we will no longer show them.

By placing content on Vimeo, you also give Vimeo users the right to view and use your content, as intended through the normal functionality of the website.

Videos that you upload or otherwise transmit to VIMEO through the Services **shall at all times remain your sole and exclusive property**. As such, you shall be solely responsible for your videos and the consequences of their posting or publication on or via the Services. Video uploads, like any Submissions (as defined below), are subject to VIMEO’s COMMUNITY STANDARDS AND CONDUCT policy below.

By submitting your video(s), you hereby grant VIMEO and its affiliates, successors and assigns a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sub-licensable (through multiple tiers) and transferable license (with a right to create derivative works to the extent necessary to make video content compatible with any Vimeo Services), **revocable upon removing the video from Vimeo**, to use, copy, transmit or otherwise distribute, perform, modify, incorporate into other works, publicly perform and display your videos or any portion thereof, in or through any medium, whether now known or hereafter created. VIMEO shall also be entitled to use clips of any video that has not been designated “private” for the purpose of promoting the Vimeo Site or Services, without compensation to the submitter; however, **Vimeo will not use your videos for any other commercial purposes without obtaining your prior approval**.

You also grant each user (or specified users, if a video is designated “private”) of the Vimeo Site or Services a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, personal and non-commercial license to access and view your video through the Vimeo Site or any other access point authorized by you and/or VIMEO. This right to access and view your video shall include, **solely to the extent necessary**, the right to copy, transmit or otherwise distribute, perform, publicly perform, create derivative works of, and display your video. Unless designated “private,” all video uploads will be deemed public information. No video upload shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of VIMEO, and VIMEO shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any video.

**When you remove or otherwise delete a video from the Services, the licenses granted by you to VIMEO and the Vimeo Site users shall terminate within a commercially reasonable time**. You understand and agree, however, that VIMEO may retain (but not display, distribute, or perform) server copies of videos that have been removed or deleted, and that VIMEO shall have no obligation to attempt to remove from distribution any of your videos that are otherwise publicly available through the Internet or other publicly accessible medium.

If you are looking for further information regarding VIMEO’s upload policies, please see VIMEO’s Uploading Guidelines [here](/guidelines#uploading_guidelines). Note: these Guidelines are provided for guidance purposes only. All uploads are governed by these Terms of Service.

Non-Video Submissions and Correspondence With Vimeo (This Section does *not* apply to video uploads discussed above)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all comments, suggestions, ideas, graphics, content, data and other information that you transmit to VIMEO through the Services (each, a “Submission”) shall remain your sole and exclusive property, and you shall be solely responsible for your Submission and the consequences of posting or publishing it. All Submissions are subject to VIMEO’s COMMUNITY STANDARDS AND CONDUCT policy below.

By submitting your Submission to VIMEO, you hereby grant VIMEO and its affiliates, successors and assigns a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sub-licensable (through multiple tiers) and transferable license (with a right to create derivative works), to use, copy, transmit or otherwise distribute, perform, modify, adapt, incorporate into other works, publicly perform and display your Submission or any portion thereof, in or through any medium, whether now known or hereafter created. In addition, you waive any and all so-called “moral rights” in Submissions. VIMEO shall be entitled to use all or a portion of any Submission without compensation to the submitter. The licenses granted by you herein with respect to non-video Submissions are perpetual and irrevocable.

You also grant each user of the Vimeo Site and Services a non-exclusive license to access your Submission through the Vimeo Site or any other access point authorized by VIMEO, and to use, copy, transmit or otherwise distribute, perform, publicly perform, create derivative works of, and display your Submission to the extent expressly authorized by VIMEO on the Vimeo Site and/or in this TOS. None of the Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of VIMEO, and VIMEO shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions.

Waiver; Representations & Warranties

Notice: User-Generated-Content Disclaimer; Option to Review/Remove
------------------------------------------------------------------

We’re not Big Brother, so we don’t spend our days browsing through all of the Forums, postings, etc., on Vimeo. That means that you may see postings from users that you find offensive and we can’t be held responsible for everything people say. If you see something that violates the [Community Guidelines](/guidelines#uploading_guidelines), please report it.

VIMEO does not and cannot review all videos or Submissions posted to or created by users accessing the Services (including, but not limited to, the Vimeo Site), and is not in any manner responsible for the content of these videos, communications, comments or Forum postings, or the activities of Vimeo.com users.

You acknowledge that by providing you with the ability to view and distribute user-generated-content through the Services (including, but not limited to, the Vimeo Site), VIMEO is merely acting as a passive conduit for the distribution of such information, and is not undertaking any obligation or liability relating to the content or the users’ activities. Accordingly, VIMEO does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity, completeness, non-infringement or quality of such content. VIMEO and its respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers and shareholders do not undertake or assume any duty to monitor the Vimeo Site for inappropriate content. You understand that by using the Vimeo Site or Services, you may be exposed to content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will VIMEO be liable in any way for any content, including, but not limited to, for any errors or omissions in any content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any content posted, emailed or otherwise transmitted on or via the Vimeo Site or Services. VIMEO and its respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers and shareholders assume no responsibility or liability which may arise from the content thereof, including, but not limited to, claims for defamation, libel, slander, infringement, invasion of privacy and publicity rights, obscenity, pornography, profanity, fraud, or misrepresentation.

We may, however, monitor some areas of Vimeo, including channels, groups, forums, and comments of Videos, We can block or remove content that is abusive, defamatory, obscene, fraudulent, misleading, violative of someone else’s rights or is otherwise offensive or unacceptable to us, in our discretion. In other words—Vimeo is a quality site. We don’t like junk, and if we see it, we’ll remove it.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, VIMEO reserves the right to (i) monitor some, all, or no areas of the channels, groups, comments and Forums for adherence to these or other rules that may be published from time to time; and (ii) block or remove videos, comments, Forum postings, Submissions or materials that it determines to be (a) abusive, defamatory, or obscene, (b) fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading; (c) in violation of a copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, intellectual property or other rights of another or (d) offensive or otherwise unacceptable to VIMEO, in its sole discretion.

All pictures, graphics, videos or other visual media displayed on the Vimeo Site are exempt from the provision of 18 U.S.C. section 2257 and 28 C.F.R. 75 because said visual media do not consist of depictions of conduct as specifically listed in 18 U.S.C. section 2256 (2) (A) through (D), but are merely depictions of non-sexually explicit nudity, or are depictions of simulated sexual conduct, or are otherwise exempt because the visual depictions were created prior to July 3, 1995.

The owners and operators of the Vimeo Site and Services are not the primary producer (as that term is defined in 18 U.S.C. section 2257 or subsequent case law defining such) of any of the visual content contained in the Vimeo Site.

Links/External Sites and Resources
----------------------------------

Vimeo or its users may post links to other sites (including through ads). In addition, other sites may make mention of Vimeo or link to vimeo.com. Those sites are operated by other people or companies, so we can’t be responsible for the content, goods or services offered on such sites. There are some weird sites out there—proceed with caution.

The Services and certain Submissions may contain, and other users or third parties may provide, advertisements for or links to other World Wide Web sites or resources. These sites and resources are not controlled by VIMEO, and the mere existence of the link on the Vimeo Site does not imply an endorsement or sponsorship by VIMEO. External Web sites and resources are not subject to these Terms and Conditions or the VIMEO Privacy Policy, and may be subject to other terms and conditions or policies posted therein. Because VIMEO has no control over such sites and resources, you acknowledge and agree that VIMEO is not responsible for the availability of such external sites or resources, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any Submission, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites or resources. You further acknowledge and agree that VIMEO shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any Submission, goods or services available on or through any external site or resource. Your use of external sites or resources is at your own risk.

Disclaimer
----------

We’ll do our best to maintain 24/7 service, but nobody’s perfect—there may be unscheduled outages.

VIMEO and its service providers utilize diligent efforts to maintain the Services, but VIMEO and its service providers are not responsible for any defects or failures associated with the Services, including, without limitation, the email service, or any damages (such as lost profits or other consequential damages) that may result from any such defects or failures.

YOU AGREE TO IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY VIMEO OF ANY UNAUTHORIZED USE OF YOUR ACCOUNT OR ANY OTHER BREACH OF SECURITY KNOWN TO YOU.

Termination and Modification
----------------------------

We can’t be everything to everybody; if you’re doing something we or law enforcement believe to be objectionable, we may suspend or terminate your access/account, and may investigate the matter further.

Vimeo may stop or modify its services. We may also delete or restrict accounts. We need to be able to use our business judgment to operate in the way or manner best suited to our needs.

In addition to any other rights or remedies available to it, VIMEO reserves the right to immediately suspend, terminate, access and investigate the user account of any user upon receipt of a subpoena or law enforcement request, or when VIMEO believes, in its sole discretion, that a user is transmitting or is otherwise connected with the distribution of unsolicited bulk email messages (SPAM) or any harassing email messages or Forum posts, or with any fraudulent, misleading, illegal or otherwise objectionable activities. Because of the difficulty associated with quantifying damages, if actual damages cannot be reasonably calculated then you agree to pay VIMEO liquidated damages of $5 for each piece of unsolicited bulk email transmitted from or otherwise connected with your account or the maximum liquidated damages permitted under law, whichever is greater; otherwise you agree to pay VIMEO’s actual damages, to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated.

You agree that VIMEO, in its sole and absolute discretion, may terminate your password, account (or any part thereof) or use of the Services, and remove and discard any Submission(s) or other content within the Services, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if VIMEO believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of the Terms of Service. VIMEO may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Services, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Services under any provision of this Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that VIMEO may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Services. Further, you agree that VIMEO shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the Services.

The provisions of these Terms of Service pertaining to disclaimers, exclusion of damages, limitations of liability and indemnification shall survive termination.

Governing Law and Other Miscellaneous Terms
-------------------------------------------

We’re New Yorkers (most of us, anyway). As New Yorkers, these Terms of Service and your use of Vimeo.com is governed by New York law. Any lawsuits or other messiness would take place exclusively in New York, NY.

These terms of service (and any related documents or policies mentioned in the terms of service) are the sole terms governing your relationship with Vimeo. If the terms are updated, the updated terms replace and previously posted terms.

If you enter into any separate agreement with us, and any terms of that agreement conflicts any of these terms of service, the terms of the separate agreement will apply.

Your rights, promises and obligations under these terms are your own—you can’t assign or transfer them without our consent.

If you have questions or need clarification, [contact us here](/help).

These Terms of Service (and any further rules, policies or guidelines incorporated by reference herein) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law, and without application of the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act or the United Nations Convention of Controls for International Sale of Goods. You agree that the Vimeo Site (and all Services) is deemed a passive website that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over VIMEO or its respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers or shareholders, either specific or general, in any jurisdiction other than the State of New York. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these terms, or your use or non-use of the Services, shall be filed only in the state or federal courts located in New York County in the State of New York and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. You hereby irrevocably waive any right you may have to trial by jury in any such dispute, action or proceeding.

These Terms of Service (and any further policies or documents incorporated by reference herein) constitute the entire understanding between VIMEO and users of the Vimeo Site and Services concerning the subject matter hereof and may not be modified except by revised Terms of Service posted by VIMEO. These Terms of Service, which may be modified or amended by VIMEO from time to time, in its sole discretion, supersedes all prior understandings and agreements, whether written or verbal with respect to the subject matter hereof. If any of the provisions of these Terms of Service will contravene, or be invalid under, the laws of the particular jurisdiction where performed, such contravention or invalidity will not invalidate the whole agreement, rather these Terms of Service will be construed as if not containing the particular provision or provisions held invalid, and the rights and obligations of the parties will be construed and enforced accordingly. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the TOS does not modify, alter or amend any other specific agreement you have entered or will enter into with VIMEO. To the extent that any provision of the TOS, or any supplemental agreement offered as any part of any registration for additional services on the Vimeo Site or within the Services, conflicts with any provision of your other agreements with VIMEO, the terms and conditions of such other agreement shall, take precedence over the conflicting term(s) and conditions of this TOS, unless otherwise expressly provided in such other agreement.

No failure or delay by VIMEO in exercising any right or privilege under these Terms of Service will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or privilege under these Terms of Service. If any provision of these Terms of Service shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

THAT’S ALL FOLKS!

These Terms of Service are binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of both parties and their respective successors, heirs, executor, administrators, personal representatives and permitted assigns. Users may not assign their rights or obligations hereunder without VIMEO’s prior written consent.
